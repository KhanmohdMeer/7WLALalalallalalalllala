      <h1>Rose Day 🌹</h1>
      <p>
        A rose feels simple, but it carries meaning.<br><br>
        Somewhere between conversations, shared moments, and quiet thoughts,
        I started noticing you differently.<br><br>
        The way you smile, the way you exist so effortlessly — it stayed with me.
        This is just the beginning of saying that you matter to me 🌹.

      <p>
        I’ve thought about how to say this without making it heavy.<br><br>
        I like you. And I have feelings for you.<br><br>
        I’m not saying this to change anything.
        I’m not asking you to feel the same.<br><br>
        You can stay exactly the way you are.
        Be yourself. Be comfortable. Be free.<br><br>
        Liking you already feels enough 💍.

      <p>
            I don’t know if I ever cross your mind, but you cross mine—in loud rooms
                filled with people, in moments of joy, while playing, and even when no one
                    is around.
                      </p>

                        <p>
                            Liking you has always been silent, yet it fills my heart more than words
                                ever could.
                                  </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I won’t ask for more than this. I just wish you warmth, peace, smiles,
                                            safety, and comfort—today and in all the days to come. I quietly pray that
                                                life is kind to you, that your heart feels light, and that you’re always
                                                    protected in ways you may never notice.

          <p>
                  I don’t know what the future looks like.
                          I don’t know how easy or difficult the path could be.

                                          But if there’s one thing I’m sure about —
                                                  <strong>I choose you.</strong>

                                                                                  But because my heart feels calm when it thinks of you.
                                                                                      </p>
