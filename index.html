      <h1>Rose Day 🌹</h1>
      <p>
        A rose feels simple, but it carries meaning.<br><br>
        Somewhere between conversations, shared moments, and quiet thoughts,
        I started noticing you differently.<br><br>
        The way you smile, the way you exist so effortlessly — it stayed with me.
        This is just the beginning of saying that you matter to me 🌹.

      <h1>Propose Day 💍</h1>
      <p>
        I’ve thought about how to say this without making it heavy.<br><br>
        I like you. And I have feelings for you.<br><br>
        I’m not saying this to change anything.
        I’m not asking you to feel the same.<br><br>
        You can stay exactly the way you are.
        Be yourself. Be comfortable. Be free.<br><br>
        Liking you already feels enough 💍.

        Chocolate Day is about sweetness,

      <h1>Teddy Day 🧸</h1>
      <p>
            I don’t know if I ever cross your mind, but you cross mine—in loud rooms
                filled with people, in moments of joy, while playing, and even when no one
                    is around.
                      </p>

                        <p>
                            Liking you has always been silent, yet it fills my heart more than words
                                ever could.
                                  </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I won’t ask for more than this. I just wish you warmth, peace, smiles,
                                            safety, and comfort—today and in all the days to come. I quietly pray that
                                                life is kind to you, that your heart feels light, and that you’re always
                                                    protected in ways you may never notice.
                                                      </p>

                                                        <p class="soft-line">
                                                            Some things are meant to be kept softly, like a teddy held close—never
                                                                shown, but never let go.

    <!-- 🤝 PROMISE DAY -->
    <section class="screen" id="promise">
      <img src="assets/promise.gif" class="day-gif" alt="Promise Day">
      <h1>🌸 Promise Day</h1>
      <p>I don’t know what the future looks like.
      I don’t know how easy or difficult the path could be.
    </p>  
    <p>
    But if there’s one thing I’m sure about —
  <strong>I choose you.</strong>
  </p>
  <p> Not because it’s simple.
    Not because it’s guaranteed.
    But because my heart feels calm when it thinks of you.
  </p>
 <p>
I can’t promise a perfect life.
  But I promise loyalty.
I promise effort.
I promise consistency.
</p>
<p>
If life ever gives me the chance to stand beside you,
I won’t walk away when things get heavy.
I won’t disappear when situations get complicated.
</p>
<p>
I will respect your pace.
I will respect your silence.
I will respect your fears.
</p>
<p>
If something in my life ever becomes a problem for us,
I will fix it.
If I need to grow, I will grow.
If I need to change, I will change —
because you’re worth becoming better for.
</p>

<p>
I promise to be your safe place.
Your peace in chaos.
Your quiet strength.
</p>
<p>
And whether the world makes it easy or not,
I will always choose you — with a steady heart.💞
